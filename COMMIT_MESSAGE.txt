Transition to samod for Rust CLI

Major refactor to use samod (Rust automerge-repo) instead of custom server.

Changes:
- Removed custom WebSocket server (src/main.rs)
- Removed old CLI client (src/bin/cli_client.rs)
- Updated repo_client.rs to use samod with proper protocol
- Added clap for better CLI UX
- Handle Automerge Text objects correctly
- Added --verbose flag for debug logging

Architecture:
  Browser (JS) ──┐
                 ├──► Sync Server :3030 ◄──── Rust CLI (samod)
  Browser (JS) ──┘

Benefits:
+ Full automerge-repo protocol compatibility
+ Works with any automerge-repo sync server
+ True cross-platform collaboration
+ No custom server maintenance

Known Issues:
- Race condition on initial sync (2s sleep workaround)
  TODO: Listen for sync completion events

See SAMOD_INTEGRATION.md and TRANSITION_SUMMARY.md for details.
